# Node Microservices with Docker and AWS ECS

Node and microservices go together like nuts and honey, like SPF 50 and Cancun, like hipsters and IPA. You get the idea. Some of you might not even know exactly what the heck microservices are. Let me give you my brief definition. 

Microservices are small services. A microservice will have just one functionality, but it will have everything that functionality needs. 

Let's say you have a service that is giving you an interface to a cookie machine. You can bake a cookie, save a template of a new cookie recipe (gluten-free!), get stats on cookie production, and do all the other boring but necessary stuff a service can do, such called CRUD, from create, read, update and delete. 

To continue with this example, now your task is to break this monolithic service into microservices. One microservice will be baking cookies. Another microservice will be saving new cookie recipes for baking by the first microservice, or whatever. In other words, instead of a single application with one staging, one CI/CD, and one production, now you have several applications each with their own staging environment, CI/CD, production environment, and other hassles. 

Why bother? Because microservices will allow you to scale different parts of your system up or down *independently*. Let's say there's very little need for new recipes, but there's a huge demand for the orders coming from chat bots (yet another microservice). Good. With microservices, you can scale just the chat bot cookie-ordering microservice (app) and not waste your precious pennies on scaling any other services. On the other hand, with a monolithic app, you have to scale everything at once, which of course takes up more RAM, CPU, and coffee consumed. 

There's a fancy term in computer science that will make you look smart (if you work in enterprise) or snobbish (if you work in a startup). Nevertheless, the term describes the microservices philosophy nicely. It's *loose coupling*, and according to many CS books and classes, if you use it you'll get flexibility, ease of maintenance, and enough health to enjoy your retirement.

As with many tech concepts, microservices technology has gone through a cycle of overhype. It has advantages and disadvantages. Uber for example has over 2,500 microservices, and its engineers starting to see problems because of complexity and other issues of managing so many separate apps. Hate them or love, the best thing is to know and use microservices when you see a fit. Again, Node is brilliant for microservices because it's light weight, fast and because more and more developers prefer not to have switch of context and use JavaScript for their server-side language.

The project of creating a microservice in a container and deploying it to the cloud is divided into four parts:

1. Creating a local Node project, a microservice RESTful API that connects to MongoDB
2. Dockerizing Node project, i.e., turning a local project into a Docker image
3. Setting up Docker networks for multi-container setup
4. Deploying the Docker microservice image to the cloud, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Service (EC2)

# Installing Installations

Before doing the exercise in this chapter, make sure you have the following: 

1. Docker engine
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
1. AWS CLI (`aws-cli`)


## Installing Docker Engine

Next, you would need to get the Docker engine (daemon). If you are a macOS user like I am, then the easiest way to install the daemon is to just go to and download it from the official Docker website: <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac>.

And if you are not a macOS user, then you can select one of the options from this Docker website page: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation>.


To verify installation, run:

```
docker version
```

It's good if you see something like this:

```
Client:
 Version:      17.03.1-ce
 API version:  1.27
 Go version:   go1.7.5
 Git commit:   c6d412e
 Built:        Tue Mar 28 00:40:02 2017
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

Server:
 Version:      17.03.1-ce
 API version:  1.27 (minimum version 1.12)
 Go version:   go1.7.5
 Git commit:   c6d412e
 Built:        Fri Mar 24 00:00:50 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 Experimental: true
```

The next step is to verify that Docker can pull from Hub. Run this hello world image:

```
docker run hello-world
```

If you see a message like this, most likely you didn‚Äôt start Docker:

```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?
```

Start Docker. If you used the macOS installer linked earlier, then you can utilize the GUI app from the menu bar. Figure 5-1 shows how running the Docker daemon looks on my macOS menu bar.

![](media/docker-running.png)
***Figure 15-1.** Docker macOS client in the menu bar needs to show "running"*.

On the contrary, if you see a message like the one below, then daemon is running and you are ready to work with Docker!

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

## Getting an AWS Account

You can easily get a free (trial) AWS account. You'll need a valid email and a credit card. Read about the free tier at <https://aws.amazon.com/free>, and when you are ready, sign up by clicking on "CREATE A FREE ACCOUNT".

Once you are in, make sure you can access EC2 dashboard. Sometimes AWS requires a phone call or a waiting period, but most people can get an account within 10 minutes. It's not always easy to navigate your way around the AWS web console, especially if you are a first-time user. EC2 is just one of many, many, many AWS services. EC2 belongs to the Compute family or category, while there are Database, Security, Tools, Networking and various other categories. 

Take a look at Figure 15-2 where I point to the location of the EC2 services in "Recently visited services". If this is your first time using AWS console, you won't have EC2 in the list of recent services. Right below "Recently visited services" is the Compute category that gives you the access to the EC2 dashboard.

![](media/aws-ec2.png)
***Figure 15-2.** AWS web console has Compute and EC2, which we need for microservices and containers, in the top left column*.

Using the web console is easy, but it is limited when it comes to deployment of Docker containers and their images to the AWS container registry. We can later deploy those images from this cloud registry. AWS web console is also limited in the fact that it's hard or even impossible to automate the web interface, whereas it's very easy to automate the command-line interface by writing a few shell scripts. AWS CLI will allow us to upload Docker images to the cloud. Thus, let us proceed to install the AWS CLI.

## Installing AWS CLI

Check for Python and pip with these commands: 

```bash
phyton --version
pip --version
```

Make sure you have versions 2.6+ or 3.6+ (recommended), see here: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html>. You can download Python for your OS at <https://www.python.org/downloads>.
 
You can use pip or pip3 (Python package manager) to install AWS CLI:

```
pip install awscli
```

Here's the AWS CLI installation command for macOS El Capitan:

```bash
sudo -H pip install awscli --upgrade --ignore-installed six
```

There are a few other AWS CLI Installation options:

* [*Install the AWS CLI with Homebrew*](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-install-macos.html#awscli-install-osx-homebrew): For macOS
* [*Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)*](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-bundle.html): Just download, unzip, and execute

You might be wondering how to verify the AWS CLI installation. Run the following command to verify AWS CLI installation and its version (1+ is ok):

```bash
aws --version
```

# Dockerizing Node Microservice

Before deploying anything in the cloud, let's build Node app Docker images locally. Then we  will run the image as a container *locally* in both the development and production modes. When you finish this project, you will know how to dockerize a Node project and get yummy üçç.

## Creating/Copying the Node Project

Firstly, you need to have the application code itself before you can containerize anything. Of course, you can copy the existing code from `code/banking-api`, but it's better for learning to create the project from scratch.

That's what we will do now. Create a new project folder somewhere on your local computer:

```sh
mkdir banking-api
cd banking-api
mkdir api
cd api
```

Create vanilla/default `package.json` and install required packages as regular dependencies with exact versions:

```sh
npm init -y
npm i express@4.15.2 errorhandler@1.5.0 express@4.15.2 globalog@1.0.0 monk@4.0.0 pm2@2.4.6 -SE
```


Add the following npm scripts: the first to test and the second to run the server using local `pm2`:

```js
  "scripts": {
    "test": "sh ./test.sh",
    "start": "if [[ ${NODE_ENV} = production ]]; then ./node_modules/.bin/pm2-docker start -i 0 server.js; else ./node_modules/.bin/pm2-dev server.js; fi"
  },
```

There are two CLI commands for pm2: `pm2-docker` for the container and `pm2-dev` for local development.

The full relative path `./node_modules/.bin` is recommended to make your command more robust. Local installation can be replaced with a global one with `npm i -g pm2`. However, global installation is an extra step outside of `package.json`, and the `npm i` command and doesn't allow developers to use different versions of `pm2` on one machine.

The source code for the Node+Express API (`code/ch15/banking-api/api/server.js`) is as follows:

```js
require('globalog')
const http = require('http')
const express = require('express')
const errorhandler = require('errorhandler')
const app = express()
const monk = require('monk')

const db = monk(process.env.DB_URI, (err)=>{
  if (err) {
    error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
})

const accounts = db.get('accounts')

app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(errorhandler())

app.get('/accounts', (req, res, next)=>{
  accounts.find({ }, (err, docs) =>{
    if (err) return next(err)
    return res.send(docs)
  })
})

app.get('/accounts/:accountId/transactions', (req, res)=>{
  accounts.findOne({_id: req.params.accountId}, (err, doc) =>{
    if (err) return next(err)
    return res.send(doc.transactions)
  })
})

http.createServer(app).listen(process.env.PORT, ()=>{
  log(`Listening on port ${process.env.PORT}`)
})
```

The key here is that we are using two environment variables: `PORT` and `DB_URI`. We would need to provide them in Dockerfile or in the command so the app has them set during running.

Let's verify that your application works without Docker by starting MondoGB and the app itself:

```
mongod
```

In a new terminal, launch the server with env vars:

```
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/db-dev PORT=3000 npm start
```

Yet, in another terminal make a request to your server:

```
curl http://localhost:3000/accounts
```

The result will be `[]%` because it's an empty database and accounts collection. If you use MongoUI or `mongo` shell to insert a document to db-dev database and accounts collections, then you'll see that document in the response. To learn about main `mongo` shell command, you can skim through Chapter 7 of my open-source book *Full Stack JavaScript, 2nd Edition* (<https://github.com/azat-co/fullstack-javascript>): <http://bit.ly/2KUjsui>.

The app is working, and now is the time to containerize it.

## Creating a Node.js Dockerfile

Go back to the `banking-api` folder and create an empty `Dockerfile`, which must be exactly `Dockerfile`, with no extension and starting with the capital letter D:

```
cd ..
touch Dockerfile
```

Then, write in `banking-api/Dockerfile` the base image name `FROM node:8-alpine` that is Node v8 based on Alpine. Add `CMD` as shown below. Each `Dockerfile` needs statements like these two:

```sh
FROM node:8-alpine

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Alpine is a lightweight stripped-down Ubuntu which is Linux. It means Alpine is Linux-based. At Capital One, we used Alpine for Node microservices. It worked well. The Docker image size is a few megabytes vs. ~200Mb for a full Ubuntu.

The `Dockerfile` is not yet doing everything we need it do do. So next copy the rest of the `Dockerfile` file between `FROM` and `CMD` as shown below. We will learn shortly what these statements mandate Docker to do. You can copy or ignore the comments marked by the hash sign (`#`).

```sh
FROM node:8-alpine

# Some image metadata
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="This is an example of a Node API server with connection to MongoDB. \
More details at https://github.com/azat-co/node-in-production and https://node.university"
#ARG mongodb_container_name
#ARG app_env

# Environment variables
# Add/change/overwrite with docker run --env key=value
# ENV NODE_ENV=$app_env
ENV PORT=3000
# ENV DB_URI="mongodb://${mongodb_container_name}:27017/db-${app_env}"
# agr->env->npm start->pm2-dev or pm2-docker
# User
#USER app
# Mount Volume in docker run command

# RUN npm i -g pm2@2.4.6

# Create api directory
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/api
# From now one we are working in /usr/src/api
WORKDIR /usr/src/api

# Install api dependencies
COPY ./api/package.json .
# Run build if necessary with devDependencies then clean them up
RUN npm i --production

# Copy keys from a secret URL, e.g., S3 bucket or GitHub Gist
# Example adds an image from a remote URL
ADD "https://process.filestackapi.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/resize=height:60/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/WYqKiG0xQQ65DBnss8nD" ./public/node-university-logo.png

# Copy API source code
COPY ./api/ .

EXPOSE 3000

# The following command will use NODE_ENV to run pm2-docker or pm2-dev
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Firstly, we need to create an app directory in the Docker container. `RUN` will run any shell command. These next "commands" `RUN` and `WORKDIR` in your `Dockerfile` will tell Docker to create a folder and then to set up a default folder for subsequent commands:

```
# Create api directory
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/api
# From now one we are working in /usr/src/api
WORKDIR /usr/src/api
```

`COPY` will get the project manifest file `package.json` into the container. This allows us to install app dependencies by executing `npm i`. Of course, let's skip the development dependencies (`devDependencies` in `package.json`) by using `--production`. `devDependencies` should include tools like Webpack, Babel, JSLint and so on, unless you want to test and build your project in a container.

```
# Install api dependencies
COPY ./api/package.json .
# Run build if necessary with devDependencies then clean them up
RUN npm i --production
```

Next, bundle app source by using `COPY` that takes files from the current folder on the host (using the dot `.`) and puts them into `api` folder in the container. Remember, the container folder is first, and the host is second:

```
# Copy API source code
COPY ./api/ .
```

You want to open a port cause otherwise no incoming connections will ever get to the container (all outgoing connections are open by default). 

```
EXPOSE 3000
```

Finally, you start the server with `CMD` which runs `npm start`. The list `[]` can contain more options or use a different command name.

```
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

By now the Dockerfile, which is a blueprint for your Node microservice, is ready. The code for the microservice is ready too. It's REST API with Express.

Next, we are going to build, run and verify the container by running it *locally*.

Build the image from the `banking-api` folder where you should have `Dockerfile` and the `api` folder:

```
docker build .
```

Ah. Don't forget to start the Docker Engine (daemon) before building. Ideally, you'll see 13 steps such as shown next. These steps are statements in `Dockerfile`. They're called layers. Docker brilliantly reuses layers for images when there are no changes to them.

```
docker build .

Successfully built 330df9053088
```

Each step has a hash. Copy the last hash of the image, e.g., 330df9053088 in my case.

As an interim step, we can verify our image by using a host database. In other words, our app will be connecting to the host database from a container. This is good for development. In production, you'll be using a managed database such as AWS RDS, Compose, mLabs, or a database in a separate (second) container.

To connect to your local MongoDB instance (which must be running), let's grab your host IP:

```
ifconfig | grep inet
```

Look for the value that says `inet`. For example,	`inet 10.0.1.7 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255` means my IP is 10.0.1.7.

Put the IP in the environment variable in the `docker run` command for the Docker build of the app image by substituting in the `{host-ip}` and `{app-image-id}` with *your* values:

```
docker run --rm -t --name banking-api -e NODE_ENV=development -e DB_URI="mongodb://{host-ip}:27017/db-prod" -v $(pwd)/api:/usr/src/api -p 80:3000 {app-image-id}
```

The command must be all on one line or two or more by lines joined by the backslash (`\`). As an example, the next command has my IP and my image ID in the command instead of the `{}` values. 

```
docker run --rm -t --name banking-api -e NODE_ENV=development -e DB_URI="mongodb://10.0.1.7:27017/db-prod" -v $(pwd)/api:/usr/src/api -p 80:3000 330df9053088
```

This is just an example. Don't copy my command as-is. Use your IP and image ID. 

Let me explain what each option is doing:

* `-e` passes environment variables
* `-p` maps host 80 to container 3000 (set in `Dockerfile`)
* `-v` mounts the local volume so you can change the files on the host and container app will pick up the changes automatically

Now after container is running, go ahead and verify by using `curl localhost/accounts`. You should see the response coming from the container app.

You can test the volume. Modify your `server.js` without re-building or stopping the container. You can add some text, a route, or mock data to the `/accounts`:

```js
app.get('/accounts', (req, res, next)=>{
  accounts.find({}, (err, docs) =>{
    if (err) return next(err)
    docs.push({a:1})
    return res.send(docs)
  })
})
```

Hit save in your editor on your host, `curl` again and boom! You'll see the change in the response from the app container. The change is the `a:1` response instead of the empty response `[]` as before. This means that the code *in the container* is changing because of the volume and the changes *in the host*. See what I have here as the CURL request and microservice's response:

```
curl localhost/accounts
[{"a":1}]%
```

To stop the container, simply run the `dockea stop` command with the container name that you specified when you executed the `docker run` command. Here's the `stop` command for the `banking-api` name:

```
docker stop banking-api
```

Or get the container ID first with `docker ps` and then run `docker stop {container-id}`.

The bottom line is that our `Dockerfile` is production-ready, but we can run the container in dev mode (`NODE_ENV=development`) with volumes and a host database that allows us to avoid any modifications between images and/or Dockerfiles when we go from dev to prod.

# Use Docker Networks for Multi-container Setup

Microservices are never used alone. They need to communicate with other micro and normal services.

As mentioned, `Dockerfile` you created is ready to be deployed to the cloud without modifications. However, if you want to run MongoDB or any other service in a container (instead of a host or managed solution like mLab or Compose), then you can do it with Docker networks. The idea is to create a network and launch two (or more) containers inside of this network. Every container in a network can "talk" to each other just by name.

## Creating a Docker Network

Assuming you want to name your network `banking-api-network`, run this command:

```
docker network create --driver=bridge banking-api-network
```

Verify by getting `banking-api-network` details or a list of all networks:

```
docker network inspect banking-api-network
docker network ls
```

You should see a table with network ID, driver (bridge or host), name, and so on, like this:

```
docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                  DRIVER              SCOPE
e9f653fffa25        banking-api-network   bridge              local
cd768d87acb1        bridge                bridge              local
0cd7db8df819        host                  host                local
8f4db39bd202        none                  null                local
```

Next, launch a vanilla `mongo` image in `banking-api-network` (or whatever name you used for your network). The name of the container `mongod-banking-api-prod-container` will become the host name to access it from our app:

```
docker run --rm -it --net=banking-api-network --name mongod-banking-api-prod-container mongo
```

Note: If you didn't have `mongo` image saved locally, Docker will download it for you. It'll take some time to download it but it'll happen just once, the first time.

Leave this MongoDB container running. Open a new terminal.

## Launch App into a Network

This is my command to launch my Node app in a production mode and connect to my MongoDB container which is in the same network (`banking-api-network`):

```
docker run --rm -t --net=banking-api-network --name banking-api -e NODE_ENV=production -e DB_URI="mongodb://mongod-banking-api-prod-container:27017/db-prod" -p 80:3000 330df9053088
```

The `330df9053088` must be replaced with your app image ID from the previous section when you executed the `docker build .` command. If you forgot the app image ID, then run `docker images` and look up the ID.

This time, you'll see `pm2` in a production clustered mode. I have two (2) CPUs in my Docker engine settings, hence `pm2-docker` spawned two Node processes which both listen for incoming connections at 3000 (container, 80 on the host):

```
docker run --rm -t --net=banking-api-network --name banking-api -e NODE_ENV=production -e DB_URI="mongodb://mongod-banking-api-prod-container:27017/db-prod" -p 80:3000 330df9053088
npm info it worked if it ends with ok
npm info using npm@3.10.10
npm info using node@v6.10.3
npm info lifecycle banking-api@1.0.0~prestart: banking-api@1.0.0
npm info lifecycle banking-api@1.0.0~start: banking-api@1.0.0

> banking-api@1.0.0 start /usr/src/api
> if [[ ${NODE_ENV} = production ]]; then ./node_modules/.bin/pm2-docker start -i 0 server.js; else ./node_modules/.bin/pm2-dev server.js; fi

[STREAMING] Now streaming realtime logs for [all] processes
0|server   | Listening on port 3000
1|server   | Listening on port 3000
```

The command is different than in the previous section but the image is the same. The command does NOT have a volume and has different environment variables. There's no need to use a volume since we want to bake the code into an image for portability.

Again, open a new terminal (or use an existing tab) and run CURL:

```
curl http://localhost/accounts
```

If you see `[]%`, then all is good.

Inspecting your network with `docker network inspect banking-api-network` will show that you have two (2) running containers there:

```js
...
      "Containers": {
          "02ff9bb083484a0fe2abb63ec79e0a78f9cac0d31440374f9bb2ee8995930414": {
              "Name": "mongod-banking-api-prod-container",
              "EndpointID": "0fa2612ebc14ed7af097f7287e013802e844005fe66a979dfe6cfb1c08336080",
              "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
              "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.2/16",
              "IPv6Address": ""
          },
          "3836f4042c5d3b16a565b1f68eb5690e062e5472a09caf563bc9f11efd9ab167": {
              "Name": "banking-api",
              "EndpointID": "d6ae871a94553dab1fcd6660185be4029a28c80c893ef1450df8cad20add583e",
              "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:03",
              "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.3/16",
              "IPv6Address": ""
          }
      },
  ...
```

Using a similar approach, you can launch other apps and services into the same network and they'll be able to talk with each other.

**Note** The older `--link` flag/option is deprecated. Don't use it. See <https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks>.

Let me share some of the common issues and their solutions for easy and effortless troubleshooting. Here's the top list:

* *No response:* Check that the port is mapped in the `docker run` command with `-p`. It's not enough to just have `EXPOSE` in `Dockerfile`. Developers need to have both.
* *The server hasn't updated after my code change:* Make sure you mount a volume with `-v`. You don't want to do it for production though.
* *I cannot get my IP because your command is not working on my Windows, ChromeOS, Apple Watch, etc.:* See <http://www.howtofindmyipaddress.com>.
* *I can't understand networks:* For more info on networks, see <https://blog.csainty.com/2016/07/connecting-docker-containers.html>.

# Node Containers in AWS with EC2 ECS

For the next topics, we will learn how to deploy Node microservices into ‚òÅÔ∏è. The goal is to deploy two containers (API and DB) using ECR and EC2 ECS. We will achieve this goal with the following steps:

1. Creating an AWS Elastic Cloud Registry (ECR) to store images in the cloud
2. Uploading the app image to the cloud (using ECR)
3. Creating a new ECS task definition with two (2) containers to connect them together
4. Creating a container cluster (using ECS)
5. Creating a container service and running it in the cloud (using ECS)

When you are done, you will know how to deploy scalable production-level Node microservices

## Creating a Registry (ECR)

Each image needs to be uploaded to a registry before we can use it to run a container. There is registry from Docker: <https://hub.docker.com>. AWS provides its own registry service called EC2, which stands for Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Let's use it.

Log in to your AWS web console at <https://aws.amazon.com>. Navigate to `us-west-2` (or some other region, but we are using `us-west-2` in this lab) and click on CE2 Container Service under Compute, as shown in Figure 15-3.

![](media/aws-ecs-1.png)
***Figure 15-3.** Selecting EC2 Container Service under Compute from the AWS web console*

Then click on *Repositories* from a left menu and then on a blue button named *Create repository*. Then the new repository wizard will open. It might look similar to the one on my screenshot on Figure 15-4.

![](media/aws-ecs-2.png)
***Figure 15-4.** Configure repository is step 1 of creating ECR that prompts for the container repository name*.

Enter the name of your repository for container images. I picked `azat-main-repo` because my name is Azat and I have great imagination. Do the same. Not in the sense of picking the same name, but in the sense of naming your repository with some name which you can easily remember later. You can see my screen in Figure 15-5. It shows the future repository URI right away.

![](media/aws-ecs-3.png)
***Figure 15-5.** Example of entering the name of the ECR as `azat-main-repo`*

Click "Next step". On Step 2, you will see bunch of commands (Figure 15-6). Write them down and put somewhere safe... away from a dog that can eat it.


![](media/aws-ecs-4.png)
***Figure 15-6.** Building and pushing instructions (step 2 of creating ECR) which explains how to upload Docker images.*

I have successfully created the repository, and my URI is:

```
161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo
```

What is your URI? Send me a postcard. 

Next, follow instructions shown to you to upload an image. You must build it before uploading/pushing. You'll need AWS CLI. If you still don't have it, then install the AWS CLI and Docker now. I list the commands to build and upload the image next.

**Command 1:** Retrieve the docker login command that you can use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry:

```
aws ecr get-login --region us-west-2
```

**Command 2:** Run the docker login command that was returned in the previous step. For example,

```
docker login -u AWS -p eyJwYXlsb2FkIjoiQ1pUVnBTSHp
FNE5OSU1IdDhxeEZ3MlNrVTJGMUdBRlAxL1k4MDhRbE5lZ3JUW
...
W5VK01Ja0xQVnFSN3JpaHCJ0eXBlIjoiREFUQV9LRVkifQ==
-e none https://161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

The results will say:

```
Login Succeeded
```

**Command 3:**: Build your Docker image using the following command. You can skip this step if your image is already built:

```
cd code/banking-api
docker build -t azat-main-repo .
```

You might have done this already. Skip to step 4. If not, then build the app image. The build command should end with a similar-looking output:

```
...
Step 13/13 : CMD npm start
> Running in ee5f0fb12a2f
> 91e9122e9bed
Removing intermediate container ee5f0fb12a2f
Successfully built 91e9122e9bed
```


**Command 4:** After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

```
docker tag azat-main-repo:latest 161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo:latest
```

Output: there's no output.

**Command 5:** Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

```
docker push 161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo:latest
```

AWS relies on the `docker push` command. Here's the push output example:

```
The push refers to a repository [161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo]
9e5134c1ad7a: Pushed
e949bf24b1c4: Pushed
2b5c968a7072: Pushed
858e5e857851: Pushed
10e038bbd0ad: Pushed
ad2f0f4f7c5a: Pushed
ec6eb0ab894f: Pushed
e0380bb6c0bb: Pushed
9f8566ee5135: Pushed
latest: digest: sha256:6d1cd529ced84a6cff1eb5f6cffaed375717022b998e70b0d33c86db26a04c74 size: 2201
```

Remember üìù the digest value (the last hash). Compare the digest with one in the repository when you look up your image in the web console in EC2 -> ECS -> Repositories -> azat-main-repo, as demonstrated in Figure 15-7.

![](media/aws-ecs-5.png)
***Figure 15-7.** The image uploaded to the newly created container repository is listed with the correct digest and timestamp*.

For more information on the steps below, [visit the ECR documentation page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_GetStarted.html).

The image's in the cloud, and now is the time to set up a certain mechanism to run this image.

## Create a New Task Definition

Tasks are like run commands in Docker CLI (`docker run`) but for multiple containers. Typical tasks define:

* Container images to use
* Volumes, if any
* Networks
* Environment variables
* Port mappings

Go to the Task Definitions in EC2 ECS and, as you might guess, press on the button which says *"Create new Task Definition"*, as it does in Figure 15-8.

![](media/aws-ecs-6.png)
***Figure 15-8.** Creating a new task definition is easily done from the Task Definitions screen.*

### Defining the Main Task Settings for the Example

Use the following settings for the task to make sure your project is running (because some other values might make the project nonfunctional):

* Two containers: `banking-api` (private AWS ECR) and `mongodb` (from Docker hub)
* Connect to `mongodb` via the network alias
* Map 80 (host) to 3000 (container) for `banking-api`
* Set env vars for `NODE_ENV` and `DB_URI`

Let's define the first container‚ÄîNode app `banking-api`.

### Defining the First Container: App

Start defining the first container in the task. Enter the name: `banking-api-container`.

Then define the image URL taken from the repository (your URL will be different), e.g.,

```
161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo:latest
```

Define host 80 and container 3000 ports in port mappings. Name, image, and ports are shown below in Figure 15-9. The values are `banking-api-container`, `161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo:latest`, and `80:3000` respectively.

![](media/aws-ecs-7.png)
***Figure 15-9.** The correct API container configurations have name, image ID, and port values.*

Scroll down in the same modal view and add Env Variables (Figure 15-10):

```
DB_URI=mongodb://mongod-banking-api-prod-container:27017/db-prod
NODE_ENV=production
```

Add to Links, as shown in Figure 15-10, the name of the future MongoDB container to give this app container an access to the database container (second not defined yet container). We map the name of the DB container in this app container and the name of the DB container in ECS. The name of the DB container in this app must be the same as the value used in Env Variables for `DB_URI`. To keep it simple, I use the same name `mongod-banking-api-prod-container` in all four places (the fourth is when I define the DB container shown on Figure 15-11).

```
mongod-banking-api-prod-container:mongod-banking-api-prod-container
```

A picture's worth a thousand words. Ergo, see the screengrab below on Figure 15-10 that shows the correct values for the environment variables and the Network settings to link the database to the API.

![](media/aws-ecs-8.png)
***Figure 15-10.** Environment variables and network settings for the API container*

That's it for the API container. Next we will deal with the database container settings which we must define *in the same task definition* as the API container.

### Defining the Second Container: Database

Analogous to the previous container (API), define the name and URL with these values for the DB container (Figure 15-11):

* *Name*: `mongod-banking-api-prod-container`
* *Image URL*: `registry.hub.docker.com/library/mongo:latest`

![](media/aws-ecs-9.png)
***Figure 15-11.** Database container settings have name and image URL*

The next piece is very important because it allows API to connect to this database container, so pay attention closely. Scroll down to the hostname in the Network settings and enter Hostname as `mongod-banking-api-prod-container`, as shown below in Figure 15-12.

![](media/aws-ecs-10.png)
***Figure 15-12.** Defining hostname as `mongo-banking-api-prod-container` for the database container*

After this hostname, we are done with the database container settings. Since you've added two containers to the task, everything is ready to create the task. Do it and you'll see a screen similar to the one shown below in Figure 15-13.

![](media/aws-ecs-10-2.png)
***Figure 15-13.** The newly created task shows two containers and their respective image IDs correctly*

Alternatively, you could specify volumes for database and/or the app at the stage of the task creation. But I will leave that for the next book. Send me a $5 Starbucks gift card, if you're interested in this topic.

## Creating Cluster

Cluster is the place where AWS runs containers. They use configurations similar to EC2 instances (Figure 15-14). Define the following:

* *Cluster name:* `banking-api-cluster`
* *EC2 instance type:* m4.large (for more info on EC2 type, see [AWS Intro course on Node University](https://node.university/p/aws-intro))
* *Number of instances:* 1
* *EBS storage:* 22
* *Key pair:* None
* *VPC:* New

If you are not familiar with AWS EC2, then I wrote a blog post: <http://bit.ly/2J6rzT0>.

![](media/aws-ecs-11.png)
***Figure 15-14.** "Create Cluster" page with settings not unlike settings of an EC2 instance*

Launch the cluster. It might take a few minutes (Figure 15-15 and 15-16).

![](media/aws-ecs-12.png)
***Figure 15-15.** Launching a cluster has three steps: cluster, IAM policy, and CF stack resources.*

You'll see the progress as shown in Figure 15-5. Under the hood, AWS uses AWS CloudFormation which is a declarative way to create not just single resources such as Virtual Private Clouds or EC2 instances but whole stacks of dozens or more of such resources. CloudFormation (CF) is like an aircraft carrier. I talk more about CF in my course: <https://node.university/p/aws-intermediate>.

Later, you'll start seeing these resources as I captured in Figure 15-16. All of them will enable the smooth running and functioning of your containers. There are much more to AWS. I recommend learning CloudFormation, EC2 and VPCs. If you want to learn more about AWS and Node besides what's covered in this chapter, read [my free blog posts and tutorials](https://node.university/blog) and take [some of my AWS courses](https://node.university/courses/category/Cloud) on Node University at: <https://node.university/blog> and <https://node.university/courses/category/Cloud>. 

![](media/aws-ecs-13.png)
***Figure 15-16.** Creating a cluster involves creating multiple AWS resources which are shown at the bottom: VPC, security group, routes, subnets, autoscaling groups, etc.*

Finally, you'll see that the cluster is ready (Figure 15-17) after ECS created a lot of EC2 resources for you, such as Internet Gateway, VPC, security group, Auto Scaling group, etc. That's great because you don't have to create them manually. The cluster is ready in its own VPC with a subnet 1 and 2. 

In my example on Figure 15-17, you can see the Availability Zones (AZs) `us-west-2c`, `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b`. (AZ is like a data center.) That's good because in case something happens in one AZ, we will have the ability to launch or use another AZ.

![](media/aws-ecs-14.png)
***Figure 15-17.** The cluster is created when resources are created.*

We uploaded images, created task definition and launched the cluster. However, if you are thinking we were done, then you are mistaken my friend. The next step is to create a service because no app is running yet without the service.

## Creating the Cloud Container Service and Verifying it

The last step is to create a service that will take the task and the cluster and make the containers in the task run in the specified cluster. That's an oversimplified explanation, because the service will do more, such as monitor health and restart containers.

Go to Create Services which is under Task Definition -> banking-api-task -> Actions -> Create Service. You will see this that our ECS service is ready because it's been created, as shown in my screenshot on Figure 15-18. (Amazon made a mistake by writing Elastic Container Service service with a double "service".)

![](media/aws-ecs-15.png)
***Figure 15-18.** ECS service banking-api-service is ready.*

Phew. üòÖ Everything should be ready by now. The containers should be *RUNNING*. To verify it, we need to grab a public IP or public DNS. To do so, click Clusters -> `banking-api-cluster` (cluster name) -> ESC Instances (tab) and Container instance as illustrated in Figure 15-19, which shows the running container instance with the corresponding Public DNS and Public IP. We need those. Either one of them. 

![](media/aws-ecs-16.png)
***Figure 15-19.** Container instance under the cluster shows public IP and DNS name.*

Copy the public IP or DNS üìù for that cluster (which is like an EC2 instance). We will need it for testing.

First, we need a dynamic content test. That's the Node API and MongoDB. To test the dynamic content (content generated by the app with the help of a database), open in a browser with `{PUBLIC_DNS}/accounts`. Most likely the response will be `[]` because the database is empty, but that's a good response. The server is working and can connect to the database from a different container.


Next, we need a static content test, which is our static asset, i.e., image, inside of the container.

To test the static content such as an `png` image which was downloaded from the Internet by Docker (`ADD` in `Dockerfile`) and baked into the container image, navigate to http://{PUBLIC_DNS}/node-university-logo.png. You should see the images that Docker downloaded via `ADD`. That's the image in the image. Using `ADD`, you can fetch any data from a URL. For example, you can fetch HTTPS certificates from a private S3.

## Terminate Service and Cluster/Instances

Don't forget to terminate your service and instances. Otherwise, you will be still paying dinero for running those cloud resources. (I am sure you can find a better way to spend the money. For example, buying some DOGECOIN.) You can terminate resources from the AWS web console. Do so for ECS first. Make sure you remove tasks. 

Summary
=======

Microservices is an old concept when you think about it as decoupling and loose coupling. The less functionality you pack into an application, the more flexible and easier it will be to scale different parts of the system and to maintain it (make changes to it). There are certain downsides to microservices as well. Microservices proliferation brings all the overhead involved in monitoring, managing environments, provisioning, patches and deployments. Luckily, Node and containers and cloud services such as Docker and AWS ECS can help in reduce this complexity and management of microservices. 

In this chapter you've built your own microservice that connected to another service (MongoDB) both locally and in the cloud. You used Docker by the way of making an image. What's great about this dockerization is that your project is extremely portable. It's mostly independent of OS or any other discrepancies, which often can bite a developer in the tail. 

The next chapter is on serverless. It'll take the abstraction in the cloud to an even higher level than containers and microservices, because it allows to not have *any* environments at all. Node developers just supply the code to run it in the cloud.
